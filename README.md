# ProveIt

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.2.
This project accompanies a guide for getting started writing an Angular 2 app using the Angular CLI.  The guide is a series and the first installment is available [here](http://answersicouldntfindanywhereelse.blogspot.com/2017/04/angular-2-getting-started-with-angular.html).

As I write more installments to the guide I'll update this README with which branch corresponds to which installment.  Master will always have the most up-to-date code in it so if you're following the guide (thanks!) from the beginning, make sure to checkout the branch the corresponds with the step you're on.
